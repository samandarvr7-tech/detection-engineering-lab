# Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
To ensure the infrastructure is reproducible, I used **Terraform** to automate the provisioning of the Hetzner VPS and inject my SSH deployment keys. 

Here is the `main.tf` configuration I used to spin up the production environment:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    hcloud = {
      source  = "hetznercloud/hcloud"
      version = "~> 1.45"
    }
  }
}

provider "hcloud" {
  # Hetzner API token injected securely
  token = "<Your_Tokens_Here>"
}

resource "hcloud_ssh_key" "server_key" {
  name       = "deploy-key"
  public_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub") 
}

resource "hcloud_server" "prod" {
  name        = "resume-analyzer"
  image       = "ubuntu-24.04"
  server_type = "cpx22" 
  location    = "nbg1" 
  ssh_keys    = [hcloud_ssh_key.server_key.id]
}

output "server_ip" {
  value = hcloud_server.prod.ipv4_address
}
```
